        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>They allow us to elegantly organize the content on our page based on the topics we have.</li>
          <li>The id attribute is used to identify elements and to select them.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), to give the content style.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head opening and closing tags</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>GitHub allows us to store our code and to easily collaborate with other developers.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Use command git add -A to stage any changes which commits all files in the working branch.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS), to handle logic and allow users to interact with a website.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.</li> 
          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>The (const) keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that variable will be, and once we declare it, we can never reassign it.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
